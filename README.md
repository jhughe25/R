R Coding Samples

5/13/19 - This section includes the R code for a proteomics analysis problem for my Master's capstone course. The code pulls in the CSV file containing the 112 observations and their associated peptide levels, uses classification trees on several subsets to generate a list of important peptides, then saves that list to a separate CSV file with duplicate entries removed. For this project, we then verified those results using a separate script for LDA analysis which I have not included as this code belongs to our professor. I have also replaced the original data file with a version that has the actual peptide sequences switched out to preserve any privacy/security issues.
